#For inelastic cololisions
#momentum formula, as momentum is convserved in all linear collisions. There wil be no angular collisions becasue I am not adept with those.
#   m(10)v(10)+m(20)v(10)=m(1+2)v(1)
#we do not need kinetic energy for e\inelastic collisions. 
#
#For elastic collisions:
#momentum formula, as momentum is conserved in all linear collisions
#   m(10)v(10)+m(20)v(20)=m(11)v(11)=m(21)v(21)
#Kinetic energy formula, as kinetic energy is conserved ni elastic collisions. this is important because both velocities will change after the collision and we need to form a system of equations to find both.
#If you chgange anything, one must substitute into the other. Good Luck.
#   K=(mv^2)/2
#Kinetic energy must transfer between objects, which means that all energy levels will be diffferent before and after the collision.

#you will know the math works if, when you run a inelastic collision, the objects both have the same velociy after
#                                              an  elastic collision, the objects have separate velocities, not necessarily traveling antiparallel.
#               have fun lmao
